# Visualize Network Throughput from pcap files

I developed this program during my BSc thesis to visualize network throughput using a captured pcap file. It enabled me to generate various plots, allowing me to analyze and visualize the impact of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required packages.

```bash
pip3 install scapy pandas matplotlib pyarrow
```

## Usage

```bash
python3 graph.py
```
